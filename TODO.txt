Bugs
You can open a deleted record in the database section if you don't refresh the list.
Contacts are slow to save when created from menu, but are fine when saving from Organisation. Could be something to do with the ID feeding back to the organisation screen.
You cannot update a combobox, because it gets sent as null and skipped. Updating Organisation and asset Parent Org only works because it sets it to "", when it shouldn't.
