Bugs
----

- Contacts are slow to save when created from menu, but are fine when saving from Organisation. Could be something to do with the ID feeding back to the organisation screen.
- You cannot update a combobox, because it gets sent as null and skipped. Updating Organisation and asset Parent Org only works because it sets it to "", when it shouldn't.


Missing Features (not exactly bugs)
----------------

- Database view should refresh whenever a record is created, edited, or deleted.




Client
- Allow adding and removing data fields to organisations, contacts, assets and conferences.
- Report integration
- Allow admin to edit historical notes
- Make client inaccessible if logged out for any reason, and reduce redundant error messages when disconnected
- Get UX to a deployable state
---------
- Add database view for resources and conference types


Agent


Console


Reporting
- Export organisation, asset and contact information.
- Export conference data


Wishlist
- Add database view for conferences. This would need a lot of customisation and due to the need to set multiple criteria for numerous types
