- Learn what each part of a database creation string does.


Debug

- Try changing ports while applications are running, without restarting anything. Do once network testing can take
  place.


Troubleshooting During Development
----------------------------------

- SQL Connectivity Issues
  - No pipes on the other end of process when trying to log in with username and password.
    - Named pipes needs to be enabled in Sql Server Configuration Manager, but that still didn't fix it. I ended up
      having to resort to using Windows Authentication, this may need looking at in the future. TCP/IP will probably
      need enabling for communication over the network.
      - Update: Note that named pipes does not need to be on for Windows Authentication to work.
  - Error 5, access denied when trying to create database.
    - The main SQL Server service was logging in using some weird Windows NT account. Changed this in Sql Server
      Configuration Manager to the Local System built-in account. This may cause security issues in the finished
      product, I'm hoping I only needed to do it because of lack of user admin rights on the machine.
      - Update: admin rights on local user had nothing to do with it, it's the NT Windows account that doesn't have
        rights. This may be different in Windows Server, but no point looking into that yet.
  - Named pipes error when trying to launch sqlcmd.
    - Switch named pipes on is Sql Server Configuration Manager
